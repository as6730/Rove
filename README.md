### Technologies and Technical Challenges
  * Backend: Ruby on Rails
  * Frontend: [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)
  * UX

The biggest technical challenge: Retrieving and parsing the information from various API’s. Learning React Native.

### Technology details of React Native
This mobile app iOS application will be rooted in React Native, which will allow us to build a rich and interactive UI. We will utilize the Google API to pull information and organize their itinerary.

### Group Members and Work Breakdown
Our group consist of four members: Alexandra Savramis, Brie McNally, Rose Koron, and Todd Bergman.

+ Alexandra’s responsibilities will be:
  + Co-lead for event functionality (back-end focus in Rails).
  + Owning the interactive features of the calendar and its integration with the backend.
  + Timeline manager.

+ Brie’s responsibilities will be:
  + Co-lead for event functionality (back-end focus in Rails).
  + Finalizing the repo’s README, complete with screenshots and code snippets.
